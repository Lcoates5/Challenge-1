# Challenge-1\
My first challenge for the coding bootcamp! 

## Description 

This repository takes an existing page and edits the html to add semantic elements and cleans up the function of the css. It also adds accessability by adding "alt=" to each img element.

## Installation

First I edited the HTML to follow accessability standards by including semantic elements such as header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer. Next each image was given alt text signifying what each image contained. The title of the page was also updated to more clearly indicate the webpage type. Lastly the CSS was edited to combine elements that were repeating and unnecessary while still maintaining that structure and design of the web page.
